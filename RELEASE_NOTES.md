# Release Notes

## 2020-07-01 - Kanidm 1.1.0-alpha

This is the first alpha series release of the Kanidm Identity Management
project. Alpha releases are to help get feedback and ideas from the community
on how we can continue to make this project better for a future supported release.

It would not be possible to create a project like this, without the contributions
and help of many people. I would especially like to thank:

* Pando85
* Alberto Planas (aplanas)
* Jake (slipperyBishop)
* Charcol
* Leigh (excitedleigh)
* Jamie (JJJollyjim)
* Triss Healy (NiryaAestus)
* Samuel Cabrero (scabrero)
* Jim McDonough

### Release Highlights

* A working identity management server, including database
* RADIUS authentication and docker images
* Pam and Nsswitch resolvers for Linux/Unix authentication
* SSH public key distribution
* LDAP server front end for legacy applications
* Password badlisting and quality checking
* Memberof and reverse group management with referential integrity
