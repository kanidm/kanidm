# Release Notes

## 2023-10-31 - Kanidm 1.1.0-beta14

This is the fourteenth pre-release of the Kanidm Identity Management project. Pre-releases are to
help get feedback and ideas from the community on how we can continue to make this project better.

At this point we believe we are on the final stretch to making something we consider "release
ready". After this we will start to ship release candidates as our focus will now be changing to
finish our production components and the stability of the API's for longer term support.

### 1.1.0-beta14 Release Highlights

- Replication is in Beta! Please test carefully!
- Web UI WASM has been split up, significantly improving the responsiveness.

## 2023-05-01 - Kanidm 1.1.0-alpha12

are to help get feedback and ideas from the community on how we can continue to make this project
better for a future supported release.

The project is shaping up very nicely, and a beta will be coming soon! The main reason we haven't
done so yet is we haven't decided if we want to commit to the current API layout and freeze it yet.
There are still things we want to change there. Otherwise the server is stable and reliable for
production usage.
