Debian packaging has moved to its own repo, see https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm_ppa_automation.
The separate repo is however included here as a git submodule to facilitate ad-hoc dev builds. See the relevant [Kanidm Book chapter](https://kanidm.github.io/kanidm/stable/packaging/debian_ubuntu_packaging.html) for more detailed instructions.
