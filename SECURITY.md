# Security Policy

Thanks for taking the time to engage with the project! We believe in the concept of
[coordinated disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure) and
currently expect a 60 day grace period for resolution of any outstanding issues.

## Supported Versions

As Kanidm is in early Alpha and under heavy development, only the most recent release and current
HEAD of the main branch will be supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please log a security-template issue on Github and directly contact one of the core team members via
email:

- [William](mailto:william@blackhats.net.au)
- [James](mailto:james+kanidm@terminaloutcomes.com)

We will endeavour to respond to your request as soon as possible, no bounties are available, but
acknowledgement will be made if you like.
