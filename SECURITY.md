# Security Policy

Thanks for taking the time to engage with the project! We believe in the concept of
[coordinated disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure) and currently expect a 60
day grace period for resolution of any outstanding issues.

## Reporting a vulnerability

You can report a security vulnerability in two ways:

- [Report a vulnerability privately using GitHub security advisories][1]

- via email to our core team: [William](mailto:william@blackhats.net.au) and
  [James](mailto:james+kanidm@terminaloutcomes.com)

If you have found an issue where you're not sure whether it is a "real security bug", please report it as a security
bug. We can re-triage the issue as a regular issue if it turns out to not have security impacts.

We expect all reports to have been verified by a human before submission. Properly triaging and investigating all issues
(not just security relevant) takes up time, and we are a volunteer-driven project.

We will endeavour to respond to your request as soon as possible.

We do not offer bounties, but acknowledgement will be made if you like.
