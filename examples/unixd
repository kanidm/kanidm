## Kanidm Unixd Service Configuration - /etc/kanidm/unixd

# Kanidm unix will bind all cached credentials to a local Hardware Security
# Module (HSM) to prevent exfiltration and attacks against these. In addition,
# any internal private keys will also be stored in this HSM.
#
# * soft: A software hsm that encrypts all local key material
# * tpm: Use a tpm for all key storage and binding
# * tpm_if_possible: If a hardware tpm exists it is used, otherwise fall back to the software tpm.
#                    If the hardware tpm has previously been used, software tpm will not be used.
#
# Default: tpm_if_possible

# hsm_type = "tpm"


# If using `hsm_type = "tpm"`, this allows configuration of the TCTI name of
# the tpm to use. For more, see: https://tpm2-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/common/tcti/
#
# You should leave this value as the default kernel resource manager.
#
# Default: device:/dev/tpmrm0

# tpm_tcti_name = "device:/dev/tpmrm0"


# Default shell for users if no value is set.
#
# Default: /bin/sh

# default_shell = "/bin/sh"


# The prefix prepended to where home directories are stored. Must end with a trailing `/`.
#
# Default: /home/

# home_prefix = "/home/"


# The attribute to use for the stable home directory path. Valid choices are
# `uuid`, `name`, `spn`.

# > **NOTICE:** All users in Kanidm can change their name (and their spn) at any time. If you change
# > `home_attr` from `uuid` you _must_ have a plan on how to manage these directory renames in your
# > system. We recommend that you have a stable ID (like the UUID), and symlinks from the name to the
# > UUID folder. Automatic support is provided for this via the unixd tasks daemon, as documented
# > here.

# Default: uuid

# home_attr = "uuid"

# Controls the prefix that will be appended to the home alias when mounting home directories. Must
# end with a trailing `/`. If unset, defaults to the value of the `home_prefix`.
#
# This is option is useful when implementing a networked home directory layout. A common implementation
# is to configure a networked filesystem that contains user directories mounted at `/u/` (eg /u/$user_uuid)
# and then symlink the mounted directory into /home/$user_name when the user logs in. This can be accomplished
# with a configuration that includes the following:
#
# > home_attr = "uuid"
# > home_alias = "name"
# > home_prefix = "/u/"
# > home_mount_prefix = "/home/"
#
# Default: unset
#
# home_mount_prefix = "/home/"
#

# The default token attribute used for generating symlinks pointing to the user's home
# directory. If set, this will become the value of the home path to nss calls. It is recommended you
# choose a "human friendly" attribute here. Valid choices are `none`, `uuid`, `name`, `spn`. Defaults
# to `spn`.
#
# Default: spn

# home_alias = "spn"


# Controls if home directories should be prepopulated with the contents of `/etc/skel`
# when first created.
#
# Default: false

# use_etc_skel = false


# Chooses which attribute is used for domain local users in presentation of the uid value.
#
# Default: spn
# NOTE: Users from a trust will always use spn.

# uid_attr_map = "spn"


# Chooses which attribute is used for domain local groups in presentation of the gid value.

# Default: spn
# NOTE: Groups from a trust will always use spn.

# gid_attr_map = "spn"


# `selinux` controls whether the `kanidm_unixd_tasks` daemon should detect and enable SELinux runtime
# compatibility features to ensure that newly created home directories are labeled correctly. This
# setting as no bearing on systems without SELinux, as these features will automatically be disabled
# if SELinux is not detected when the daemon starts. Note that `kanidm_unixd_tasks` must also be built
# with the SELinux feature flag for this functionality.
#
# Default: true

# selinux = true


# allows kanidm to "override" the content of a user or group that is defined locally when a name
# collision occurs. By default kanidm will detect when a user/group conflict with their entries from
# `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/group` and will ignore the kanidm entry. However if you want kanidm to
# override users or groups from the local system, you must list them in this field. Note that this can
# have many unexpected consequences, so it is not recommended to enable this.
#
# Default: Empty set (no overrides)

# allow_local_account_override = ["admin"]


# This section enables the kanidm provider
[kanidm]

# Defines a set of POSIX groups where membership of any of these groups
# will be allowed to login via PAM. All POSIX users and groups can be
# resolved by nss regardless of PAM login status. This may be a group
# name, spn, or uuid.
#
# Default: empty set (no access allowed)

pam_allowed_login_groups = ["posix_group"]
