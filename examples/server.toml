#   The role of this server. This affects features available and how replication may interact.
#   Valid roles are:
#   - WriteReplica
#     This server provides all functionality of Kanidm. It allows authentication, writes, and
#     the web user interface to be served.
#   - WriteReplicaNoUI
#     This server is the same as a write_replica, but does NOT offer the web user interface.
#   - ReadOnlyReplica
#     This server will not writes initiated by clients. It supports authentication and reads,
#     and must have a replication agreement as a source of it's data.
#   Defaults to "WriteReplica".
# role = "WriteReplica"
