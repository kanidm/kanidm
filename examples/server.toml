#   The webserver bind address. Requires TLS certificates.
#   If the port is set to 443 you may require the
#   NET_BIND_SERVICE capability.
#   Defaults to "127.0.0.1:8443"
bindaddress = "[::]:443"
#
#   The read-only ldap server bind address. Requires
#   TLS certificates. If set to 636 you may require
#   the NET_BIND_SERVICE capability.
#   Defaults to "" (disabled)
# ldapbindaddress = "[::]:636"
#
#   HTTPS requests can be reverse proxied by a loadbalancer.
#   To preserve the original IP of the caller, these systems
#   will often add a header such as "Forwarded" or
#   "X-Forwarded-For". If set to true, then this header is
#   respected as the "authoritative" source of the IP of the
#   connected client. If you are not using a load balancer
#   then you should leave this value as default.
#   Defaults to false
# trust_x_forward_for = false
#
#   The path to the kanidm database.
db_path = "/var/lib/private/kanidm/kanidm.db"
#
#   If you have a known filesystem, kanidm can tune the 
#   database page size to match. Valid choices are:
#   [zfs, other]
#   If you are unsure about this leave it as the default
#   (other). After changing this
#   value you must run a vacuum task.
#   - zfs:
#     * sets database pagesize to 64k. You must set
#       recordsize=64k on the zfs filesystem.
#   - other:
#     * sets database pagesize to 4k, matching most
#       filesystems block sizes.
# db_fs_type = "zfs"
#
#   The number of entries to store in the in-memory cache.
#   Minimum value is 256. If unset
#   an automatic heuristic is used to scale this.
#   You should only adjust this value if you experience
#   memory pressure on your system.
# db_arc_size = 2048
#
#   TLS chain and key in pem format. Both must be present
tls_chain = "/var/lib/private/kanidm/chain.pem"
tls_key = "/var/lib/private/kanidm/key.pem"
#
#   The log level of the server. May be one of info, debug, trace
#
#   NOTE: this can be overridden by the environment variable
#   `KANIDM_LOG_LEVEL` at runtime
#   Defaults to "info"
# log_level = "info"
#
#   The DNS domain name of the server. This is used in a
#   number of security-critical contexts
#   such as webauthn, so it *must* match your DNS
#   hostname. It is used to create
#   security principal names such as `william@idm.example.com`
#   so that in a (future) trust configuration it is possible
#   to have unique Security Principal Names (spns) throughout
#   the topology.
#
#   ⚠️  WARNING ⚠️
#
#   Changing this value WILL break many types of registered
#   credentials for accounts including but not limited to
#   webauthn, oauth tokens, and more.
#   If you change this value you *must* run
#   `kanidmd domain_name_change` immediately after.
domain = "idm.example.com"
#
#   The origin for webauthn. This is the url to the server,
#   with the port included if it is non-standard (any port
#   except 443). This must match or be a descendent of the
#   domain name you configure above. If these two items are
#   not consistent, the server WILL refuse to start!
#   origin = "https://idm.example.com"
origin = "https://idm.example.com:8443"
#
[online_backup]
#   The path to the output folder for online backups
path = "/var/lib/private/kanidm/backups/"
#   The schedule to run online backups (see https://crontab.guru/)
#   every day at 22:00 UTC (default)
schedule = "00 22 * * *"
#    four times a day at 3 minutes past the hour, every 6th hours
# schedule = "03 */6 * * *"
#   We also support non standard cron syntax, with the following format:
#   sec  min   hour   day of month   month   day of week   year
#   (it's very similar to the standard cron syntax, it just allows to specify the seconds
#   at the beginning and the year at the end)
#   Number of backups to keep (default 7)
# versions = 7
