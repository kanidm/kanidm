#   The path to the kanidm database.
db_path = "/var/lib/kanidm/kanidm.db"
#
#   If you have a known filesystem, kanidm can tune database operations to match. Valid choices are:
#   [zfs, other]
#   If you are unsure about this leave it as the default (other). After changing this
#   value you must run a vacuum task.
#   - zfs:
#     * sets database pagesize to 64k. You must set recordsize=64k on the zfs filesystem.
#   - other:
#     * sets database pagesize to 4k, matching most filesystems block sizes.
# db_fs_type = "zfs"
#
#   The number of entries to store in the in-memory cache. Minimum value is 256. If unset
#   an automatic heuristic is used to scale this.
# db_arc_size = 2048
#
#   TLS chain and key in pem format. Both must be present
tls_chain = "/data/chain.pem"
tls_key = "/data/key.pem"
#
#   The log level of the server. May be one of info, debug, trace
#
#   NOTE: this is overridden by environment variables
#
#   Defaults to "info"
# log_level = "info"

#   The DNS domain name of the server. This is used in a
#   number of security-critical contexts
#   such as webauthn, so it *must* match your DNS
#   hostname. It is used to create
#   security principal names such as `william@idm.example.com`
#   so that in a (future)
#   trust configuration it is possible to have unique Service
#   Principal Names (spns) throughout the topology.
#   ⚠️  WARNING ⚠️
#   Changing this value WILL break many types of registered
#   credentials for accounts
#   including but not limited to webauthn, oauth tokens, and more.
#   If you change this value you *must* run
#   `kanidmd domain_name_change` immediately after.
domain = "idm.example.com"
#
#   The origin for webauthn. This is the url to the server, with the port included if
#   it is non-standard (any port except 443)

#
#   The role of this server. This affects features available and how replication may interact.
#   Valid roles are:
#   - WriteReplica
#     This server provides all functionality of Kanidm. It allows authentication, writes, and
#     the web user interface to be served.
#   - WriteReplicaNoUI
#     This server is the same as a write_replica, but does NOT offer the web user interface.
#   - ReadOnlyReplica
#     This server will not writes initiated by clients. It supports authentication and reads,
#     and must have a replication agreement as a source of it's data.
#   Defaults to "WriteReplica".
# role = "WriteReplica"
#
# This section if uncommented will enable online - automatic backups of your database.
# [online_backup]
#
#   The path to the output folder for online backups
#   Defaults to "" (no path set)
# path = "/var/lib/kanidm/backups/"
#
#   The schedule to run online backups. All times are interpreted in UTC.
#   The format of the cron expression is:
#
#   sec  min   hour   day of month   month   day of week   year
#
#   - to run a 6:09 pm every day.
#   "0    9    6      *              *       *             *   "
#   "0 9 6 * * * *"
#
#   - to run at midnight daily
#   @daily
#
#   - to run every hour
#   @hourly
#
#   Defaults to "@daily"
# schedule = "@daily"
#   Number of backups to keep (default 7)
# versions = 7
