# Examples of situations for consideration

## Ability to be forgotten

### Deletion is delete not flagging

When an account is deleted it must be truly deleted, not just flagged for future delete. Note that
some functionality like the recycle bin, we must keep the account details, but a recycle bin purge
does truly delete the account.

## Self determination and autonomy

### Self name change

People should be able to change their own name at anytime. Consider divorce, leaving abusive
partners or other personal decisions around why a name change is relevant.

This is why names are self-service writeable at any time.

## Free from harmful discrimination of any kind

### Cultural and Social awareness of name formats

All name fields should be case sensitive utf8 with no max or min length limit. This is because names
can take many forms such as.

- firstname middlename lastname
- firstname lastname
- firstname firstname lastname
- firstname lastname lastname
- firstname
- lastname firstname

And many many more that are not listed here. This is why our names are displayName as a freetext
UTF8 field, with case sensitivity and no limits.

## Informed consent and Privacy of their data

### Access to legalName field

legalName should only be on a "need to know" basis, and only collected if required. This is to help
people who may be stalked or harassed, or otherwise conscious of their privacy.
