# Introduction to Kanidm

Kanidm is an identity management server, acting as an authority on accounts and authorisation
within a technical environment.

The intent of the Kanidm project is to:

* Provide a single truth source for accounts, groups and privileges.
* Enable integrations to systems and services so they can authenticate accounts.
* Make system, network, application and web authentication easy and accessible.

> **NOTICE:**
> This is a pre-release project. While all effort has been made to ensure no data loss
> or security flaws, you should still be careful when using this in your environment.

## Why do I want Kanidm?

Whether you work in a business, a volunteer organisation, or are an enthusiast who manages 
their personal services, we need methods of authenticating and identifying ourselves
to these systems and subsequently, ways to determine what authorisation and privileges we have
while accessing these systems.

We've probably all been in workplaces where you end up with multiple accounts on various
systems - one for a workstation, different SSH keys for different tasks, maybe some shared
account passwords. Not only is it difficult for people to manage all these different credentials
and what they have access to, but it also means that sometimes these credentials have more
access or privilege than they require.

Kanidm acts as a central authority of accounts in your organisation and allows each account to associate
many devices and credentials with different privileges. An example of how this looks:

A key design goal is that you authenticate with your device in some manner, and then your device will
continue to authenticate you in the future. Each of these different types of credential from SSH keys,
application passwords, RADIUS passwords and others, are "things your device knows". Each password
has limited capability, and can only access that exact service or resource.

This helps improve security; a compromise of the service or the network transmission does not
grant you unlimited access to your account and all its privileges. As the credentials are specific
to a device, if a device is compromised you can revoke its associated credentials. If a
specific service is compromised, only the credentials for that service need to be revoked.

Due to this model, and the design of Kanidm to centre the device and to have more per-service credentials,
workflows and automation are added or designed to reduce human handling. An example of this
is the use of QR codes with deployment profiles to automatically enrol wireless credentials.
