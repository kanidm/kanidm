# Kanidm Administration

Kanidm is an identity management server, acting as an authority on accounts and authorisation
within a technical environment.

WARNING: This project is still under heavy development, and has not had a production ready
release yet. It may lose your data, be offline for some periods of time, or otherwise cause
disruptions if you aren't ready.

The intent of the Kanidm project is:

* To provide a single truth source for accounts, groups and privileges.
* To enable integrations to systems and services so they can authenticate accounts.
* To make system, network, application and web authentication easy and accessible.
