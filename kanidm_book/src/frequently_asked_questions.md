# Frequently Asked Questions

... or ones we think people *might* ask.

## Why disallow HTTP (without TLS) between my load balancer and Kanidm?

Because Kanidm is one of the keys to a secure network, and insecure connections
to them are not best practice.

Please refer to [Why TLS?](why_tls.md) for a longer explanation.

## Why so many crabs?

It's [a rust thing](https://rustacean.net).

## Will you implement -insert protocol here-

Probably, on an infinite time-scale! As long as it's not Kerberos. Or involves SSL or STARTTLS. Please log an issue and start the discussion!

## Why do the crabs have knives?

Don't [ask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QaAKi0NFkA). They just [do](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WizH5ae9ozw).

## Why won't you take this FAQ thing seriously?

Look, people just haven't asked many questions yet.
