# LDAP

While many applications can support external authentication and identity services through Oauth2,
not all services can. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) has been the "lingua franca" of
authentication for many years, with almost every application in the world being able to search and
bind to LDAP. As many organisations still rely on LDAP, Kanidm can host a read-only LDAP interface
for these legacy applications.

## What is LDAP

LDAP is a protocol to read data from a directory of information. It is not a server, but a way to
communicate to a server. There are many famous LDAP implementations such as Active Directory, 389
Directory Server, DSEE, FreeIPA, and many others. Because it is a standard, applications can use an
LDAP client library to authenticate users to LDAP, given "one account" for many applications - an
IDM just like Kanidm!

## Data Mapping

Kanidm cannot be mapped 100% to LDAP's objects. This is because LDAP types are simple key-values on
objects which are all UTF8 strings (or subsets thereof) based on validation (matching) rules. Kanidm
internally implements complex data types such as tagging on SSH keys, or multi-value credentials.
These can not be represented in LDAP.

Many of the structures in Kanidm do not correlate closely to LDAP. For example Kanidm only has a GID
number, where LDAP's schemas define both a UID number and a GID number.

Entries in the database also have a specific name in LDAP, related to their path in the directory
tree. Kanidm is a flat model, so we have to emulate some tree-like elements, and ignore others.

For this reason, when you search the LDAP interface, Kanidm will make some mapping decisions.

- The Kanidm domain name is used to generate the DN of the suffix.
- The domain\_info object becomes the suffix root.
- All other entries are direct subordinates of the domain\_info for DN purposes.
- Distinguished Names (DNs) are generated from the spn, name, or uuid attribute.
- Bind DNs can be remapped and rewritten, and may not even be a DN during bind.
- The '\*' and '+' operators can not be used in conjuction with attribute lists in searches.

These decisions were made to make the path as simple and effective as possible, relying more on the
Kanidm query and filter system than attempting to generate a tree-like representation of data. As
almost all clients can use filters for entry selection we don't believe this is a limitation for the
consuming applications.

## Security

### TLS

StartTLS is not supported due to security risks. LDAPS is the only secure method of communicating to
any LDAP server. Kanidm, when configured with certificates, will use them for LDAPS (and will not
listen on a plaintext LDAP port).

### Writes

LDAP's structure is too simplistic for writing to the complex entries that Kanidm internally
contains. As a result, writes are rejected for all users via the LDAP interface.

### Access Controls

LDAP only supports password authentication. As LDAP is used heavily in POSIX environments the LDAP
bind for any DN will use its configured posix password.

As the POSIX password is not equivalent in strength to the primary credentials of Kanidm (which may
be multi-factor authentication, MFA), the LDAP bind does not grant rights to elevated read
permissions. All binds have the permissions of "Anonymous" even if the anonymous account is locked.

The exception is service accounts which can use api-tokens during an LDAP bind for elevated read
permissions.

## Server Configuration

To configure Kanidm to provide LDAP, add the argument to the `server.toml` configuration:

```toml
ldapbindaddress = "127.0.0.1:3636"
```

You should configure TLS certificates and keys as usual - LDAP will re-use the Web server TLS
material.

## Showing LDAP Entries and Attribute Maps

By default Kanidm is limited in what attributes are generated or remapped into LDAP entries.
However, the server internally contains a map of extended attribute mappings for application
specific requests that must be satisfied.

An example is that some applications expect and require a 'CN' value, even though Kanidm does not
provide it. If the application is unable to be configured to accept "name" it may be necessary to
use Kanidm's mapping feature. Currently these are compiled into the server, so you may need to open
an issue with your requirements for attribute maps.

To show what attribute maps exists for an entry you can use the attribute search term '+'.

```bash
# To show Kanidm attributes
ldapsearch ... -x '(name=admin)' '*'
# To show all attribute maps
ldapsearch ... -x '(name=admin)' '+'
```

Attributes that are in the map can be requested explicitly, and this can be combined with requesting
Kanidm native attributes.

```bash
ldapsearch ... -x '(name=admin)' cn objectClass displayname memberof
```

## Service Accounts

If you have
[issued api tokens for a service account](../accounts_and_groups.html#using-api-tokens-with-service-accounts)
they can be used to gain extended read permissions for those service accounts.

Api tokens can also be used to gain extended search permissions with LDAP. To do this you can bind
with a dn of `dn=token` and provide the api token in the password.

> **NOTE** The `dn=token` keyword is guaranteed to not be used by any other entry, which is why it
> was chosen as the keyword to initiate api token binds.

```bash
ldapwhoami -H ldaps://URL -x -D "dn=token" -w "TOKEN"
ldapwhoami -H ldaps://idm.example.com -x -D "dn=token" -w "..."
# u: demo_service@idm.example.com
```

## Example

Given a default install with domain "example.com" the configured LDAP DN will be
"dc=example,dc=com".

```toml
# from server.toml
ldapbindaddress = "[::]:3636"
```

This can be queried with:

```bash
LDAPTLS_CACERT=ca.pem ldapsearch \
    -H ldaps://127.0.0.1:3636 \
    -b 'dc=example,dc=com' \
    -x '(name=test1)'

# test1@example.com, example.com
dn: spn=test1@example.com,dc=example,dc=com
objectclass: account
objectclass: memberof
objectclass: object
objectclass: person
displayname: Test User
memberof: spn=group240@example.com,dc=example,dc=com
name: test1
spn: test1@example.com
entryuuid: 22a65b6c-80c8-4e1a-9b76-3f3afdff8400
```

It is recommended that client applications filter accounts that can login with `(class=account)` and
groups with `(class=group)`. If possible, group membership is defined in RFC2307bis or Active
Directory style. This means groups are determined from the "memberof" attribute which contains a DN
to a group.

LDAP binds can use any unique identifier of the account. The following are all valid bind DNs for
the object listed above (if it was a POSIX account, that is).

```bash
ldapwhoami ... -x -D 'name=test1'
ldapwhoami ... -x -D 'spn=test1@example.com'
ldapwhoami ... -x -D 'test1@example.com'
ldapwhoami ... -x -D 'test1'
ldapwhoami ... -x -D '22a65b6c-80c8-4e1a-9b76-3f3afdff8400'
ldapwhoami ... -x -D 'spn=test1@example.com,dc=example,dc=com'
ldapwhoami ... -x -D 'name=test1,dc=example,dc=com'
```

Most LDAP clients are very picky about TLS, and can be very hard to debug or display errors. For
example these commands:

```bash
ldapsearch -H ldaps://127.0.0.1:3636 -b 'dc=example,dc=com' -x '(name=test1)'
ldapsearch -H ldap://127.0.0.1:3636 -b 'dc=example,dc=com' -x '(name=test1)'
ldapsearch -H ldap://127.0.0.1:3389 -b 'dc=example,dc=com' -x '(name=test1)'
```

All give the same error:

```bash
ldap_sasl_bind(SIMPLE): Can't contact LDAP server (-1)
```

This is despite the fact:

- The first command is a certificate validation error.
- The second is a missing LDAPS on a TLS port.
- The third is an incorrect port.

To diagnose errors like this, you may need to add "-d 1" to your LDAP commands or client.
