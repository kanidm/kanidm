# RADIUS

Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) is a network protocol 
that is commonly used to authenticate Wi-Fi devices or Virtual Private 
Networks (VPNs). While it should not be a sole point of trust/authentication 
to an identity, it's still an important control for protecting network resources.

Kanidm has a philosophy that each account can have multiple credentials which
are related to their devices, and limited to specific resources. RADIUS is
no exception and has a separate credential for each account to use for
RADIUS access.

## Disclaimer

It's worth noting some disclaimers about Kanidm's RADIUS integration.

### One Credential - One Account

Kanidm normally attempts to have credentials for each *device* and 
*application* rather than the legacy model of one to one.

The RADIUS protocol is only able to attest a *single* credential in an 
authentication attempt, which limits us to storing a single RADIUS credential 
per account. However, despite this limitation, it still greatly improves the 
situation by isolating the RADIUS credential from the primary or application 
credentials of the account. This solves many common security concerns around 
credential loss or disclosure, and prevents rogue devices from locking out 
accounts as they attempt to authenticate to Wi-Fi with expired credentials.

### Cleartext Credential Storage

RADIUS offers many different types of tunnels and authentication mechanisms.
However, most client devices "out of the box" only attempt a single type when 
a WPA2-Enterprise network is selected: MSCHAPv2 with PEAP. This is a 
challenge-response protocol that requires clear text or Windows NT LAN 
Manager (NTLM) credentials.

As MSCHAPv2 with PEAP is the only practical, universal RADIUS-type supported
on all devices with minimal configuration, we consider it imperative
that it MUST be supported as the default. Esoteric RADIUS types can be used
as well, but this is up to administrators to test and configure.

Due to this requirement, we must store the RADIUS material as clear text or
NTLM hashes. It would be silly to think that NTLM is secure as it relies on 
the obsolete and deprecated MD4 cryptographic hash, providing only an 
illusion of security.

This means Kanidm stores RADIUS credentials in the database as clear text.

We believe this is a reasonable decision and is a low risk to security because:

* The access controls around RADIUS secrets by default are strong, limited
  to only self-account read and RADIUS-server read.
* As RADIUS credentials are separate from the primary account credentials and 
  have no other rights, their disclosure is not going to lead to a full 
  account compromise.
* Having the credentials in clear text allows a better user experience as  
  clients can view the credentials at any time to enroll further devices.

## Account Credential Configuration

For an account to use RADIUS they must first generate a RADIUS secret unique 
to that account. By default, all accounts can self-create this secret.

    kanidm account radius generate_secret --name william william
    kanidm account radius show_secret --name william william

## Account Group Configuration

In Kanidm, accounts which can authenticate to RADIUS must be a member
of an allowed group. This allows you to define which users or groups may use
a Wi-Fi or VPN infrastructure, and provides a path for revoking access to the 
resources through group management. The key point of this is that service 
accounts should not be part of this group:

    kanidm group create --name idm_admin radius_access_allowed
    kanidm group add_members --name idm_admin radius_access_allowed william

## RADIUS Server Service Account

To read these secrets, the RADIUS server requires an account with the
correct privileges. This can be created and assigned through the group
"idm_radius_servers", which is provided by default.

First, create the account and add it to the group:

```shell
kanidm account create --name admin radius_service_account "Radius Service Account"
kanidm group add_members --name admin idm_radius_servers radius_service_account
```

Now reset the account password, using the `admin` account:

```shell
kanidm account credential update --name admin radius_service_account
```

## Deploying a RADIUS Container

We provide a RADIUS container that has all the needed integrations. 
This container requires some cryptographic material, laid out in a volume like so:

    data
    data/ca.pem             # This is the kanidm ca.pem
    data/config.ini         # This is the kanidm-radius configuration.
    data/certs
    data/certs/dh           # openssl dhparam -out ./dh 2048
    data/certs/key.pem      # These are the radius ca/cert/key
    data/certs/cert.pem
    data/certs/ca.pem

The config.ini has the following template:

    [kanidm_client]
    url =                   # URL to the kanidm server
    # TODO: change strict to verify_ca
    strict = false          # Strict CA verification
    ca = /data/ca.pem       # Path to the kanidm ca
    user =                  # Username of the RADIUS service account
    secret =                # Generated secret for the service account

    ; default VLANs for groups that don't specify one.
    [DEFAULT]
    vlan = 1

    ; [group.test]          # group.<name> will have these options applied
    ; vlan =

    [radiusd]
    ca =                    # Path to the radius server's CA
    key =                   # Path to the radius servers key
    cert =                  # Path to the radius servers cert
    dh =                    # Path to the radius servers dh params
    required_group =        # Name of a kanidm group which you must be 
                            # A member of to use radius.
    cache_path =            # A path to an area where cached user records can be stored.
                            # If in doubt, use /dev/shm/kanidmradiusd

    ; [client.localhost]    # client.<nas name> configures wifi/vpn consumers
    ; ipaddr =              # ipv4 or ipv6 address of the NAS
    ; secret =              # Shared secret

A fully configured example:

    [kanidm_client]
    ; be sure to check the listening port is correct, it's the docker internal port
    ; not the external one if these containers are on the same host.
    url = https://example.com
    # TODO: change strict to verify_ca
    strict = true           # Adjust this if you have CA validation issues
    ca = /data/ca.crt
    user = radius_service_account
    secret =                # The generated password from above

    ; default vlans for groups that don't specify one.
    [DEFAULT]
    vlan = 1

    [group.network_admins]
    vlan = 10

    [radiusd]
    ca = /data/certs/ca.pem
    key =  /data/certs/key.pem
    cert = /data/certs/cert.pem
    dh = /data/certs/dh
    required_group = radius_access_allowed
    cache_path = /dev/shm/kanidmradiusd

    [client.localhost]
    ipaddr = 127.0.0.1
    secret = testing123

    [client.docker]
    ipaddr = 172.17.0.0/16
    secret = testing123

You can then run the container with:

    <!-- TODO: decide if we're going to tell them to build it explicitly -->

    docker run --name radiusd -v ...:/data kanidm/radius:latest

Authentication can be tested through the client.localhost Network Access Server (NAS) configuration with:

    docker exec -i -t radiusd radtest <username> badpassword 127.0.0.1 10 testing123
    docker exec -i -t radiusd radtest <username> <radius show_secret value here> 127.0.0.1 10 testing123

Finally, to expose this to a Wi-Fi infrastructure, add your NAS in `config.ini`:

    [client.access_point]
    ipaddr = <some ipadd>
    secret = <random value>

Then re-create/run your docker instance with `-p 1812:1812 -p 1812:1812/udp` ...

If you have any issues, check the logs from the RADIUS output, as they tend 
to indicate the cause of the problem. To increase the logging level you can 
re-run your environment with debug enabled:

    docker rm radiusd
    docker run --name radiusd -e DEBUG=True -i -t -v ...:/data kanidm/radius:latest

Note the RADIUS container *is* configured to provide Tunnel-Private-Group-ID, 
so if you wish to use Wi-Fi-assigned VLANs on your infrastructure, you can 
assign these by groups in the config.ini as shown in the above examples.

## Testing the RADIUS container

Starting from the root directory of the repository, we'll generate some basic certificates. Run the generate script and just accept all the defaults:

<!-- TODO: make this less bad -->
```shell
./insecure_generate_tls.sh
<snip>
Getting CA Private Key
Certificate chain is at: /tmp/kanidm/chain.pem
Private key is at: /tmp/kanidm/key.pem
```

Build the container:

```shell
make build/radiusd
```

Run the container:

```shell
docker run --rm -it --name kanidm_radius \
    -v /tmp/kanidm/chain.pem:/etc/raddb/certs/chain.pem \
    -v /tmp/kanidm/key.pem:/etc/raddb/certs/key.pem \
    -v /tmp/kanidm/ca.pem:/etc/raddb/certs/ca.pem \
    -v /tmp/kanidm/dh.pem:/etc/raddb/certs/dh.pem \
    kanidm/radius:devel
```
