# Kanidm Python Module

Docs to go here... check `/pykanidm/`.

## Building the documentation

Building it's simple, run:

```shell
docs/pykanidm/build
```

You can also run a local live server by running:

```shell
docs/pykanidm/serve
```

This'll expose a web server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
