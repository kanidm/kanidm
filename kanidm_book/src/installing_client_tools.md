# Installing Client Tools

> **NOTE** As this project is in a rapid development phase, running different
release versions will likely present incompatibilities. Ensure you're running
matching release versions of client and server binaries. If you have any issues,
check that you are running the latest software.

## From packages

Kanidm currently is packaged for the following systems:

 * OpenSUSE Tumbleweed
 * OpenSUSE Leap 15.3/15.4
 * MacOS
 * Arch Linux
 * NixOS
 * Fedora 36
 * CentOS Stream 9

The `kanidm` client has been built and tested from Windows, but is not (yet) packaged routinely.

### OpenSUSE Tumbleweed

Kanidm has been part of OpenSUSE Tumbleweed since October 2020. You can install
the clients with:

    zypper ref
    zypper in kanidm-clients

### OpenSUSE Leap 15.3/15.4

Using zypper you can add the Kanidm leap repository with:

    zypper ar -f obs://network:idm network_idm

Then you need to refresh your metadata and install the clients.

    zypper ref
    zypper in kanidm-clients

### MacOS - Brew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) allows addition of third party repositories for installing tools. On
MacOS you can use this to install the Kanidm tools.

    brew tap kanidm/kanidm
    brew install kanidm

### Arch Linux

[Kanidm on AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&K=kanidm)

### NixOS

### Fedora / Centos Stream

{{#template

    title=Take Note!
    text=Kanidm frequently uses new Rust versions and features, however Fedora and Centos frequently are behind in Rust releases. As a result, they may not always have the latest Kanidm versions available.
}}

Fedora has limited support through the development repository. You need to add the repository
metadata into the correct directory:

    # Fedora
    wget https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/idm/Fedora_36/network:idm.repo
    # Centos Stream 9
    wget https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/idm/CentOS_9_Stream/network:idm.repo

You can then install with:

    dnf install kanidm-clients

## Cargo

The tools are available as a cargo download if you have a rust tool chain available. To install
rust you should follow the documentation for [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). These will be installed
into your home directory. To update these, re-run the install command with the new version.

    cargo install --version 1.1.0-alpha.10 kanidm_tools

## Tools Container

In some cases if your distribution does not have native kanidm-client support, and you can't access
cargo for the install for some reason, you can use the cli tools from a docker container instead.

    docker pull kanidm/tools:latest
    docker run --rm -i -t \
        -v /etc/kanidm/config:/etc/kanidm/config:ro \
        -v ~/.config/kanidm:/home/kanidm/.config/kanidm:ro \
        -v ~/.cache/kanidm_tokens:/home/kanidm/.cache/kanidm_tokens \
        kanidm/tools:latest \
        /sbin/kanidm --help

If you have a ca.pem you may need to bind mount this in as required.

> **TIP** You can alias the docker run command to make the tools easier to access such as:

    alias kanidm="docker run ..."

## Checking that the tools work

Now you can check your instance is working. You may need to provide a CA certificate for verification
with the -C parameter:

    kanidm login --name anonymous
    kanidm self whoami -H https://localhost:8443 --name anonymous
    kanidm self whoami -C ../path/to/ca.pem -H https://localhost:8443 --name anonymous

Now you can take some time to look at what commands are available - please
