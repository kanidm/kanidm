# Debian / Ubuntu Packaging

## Building packages

- While official packages are available at https://kanidm.github.io/kanidm_ppa/ these instructions will guide you
through replicating the same process locally, using [cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) & Docker to isolate the build process
from your normal computer and allow building packages for multiple architectures.
- While the examples below will use `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` aka `arm64`,
the same process works for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` aka `amd64` as well.

1. Start in the root directory of the main [kanidm/kanidm](https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm) repository.
1. Install cross:
   ```shell
   cargo install cross
   ```
1. Launch your desired crossbuild target. Do note the script assumes use of `rustup`!
   ```shell
   # See valid targets:
   platform/debian/scripts/crossbuild.sh
   # Launch a target:
   platform/debian/scripts/crossbuild.sh debian-12-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
   # You can also specify multiple targets within the same distribution:
   platform/debian/scripts/crossbuild.sh debian-12-{aarch64,x86_64}-unknown-linux-gnu
   ```
1. Go get a drink of your choice while the build completes.
1. Create a sacrificial deb builder container to avoid changing your own system:
   ```shell
   docker run --rm -it -e CI=true \
       --mount "type=bind,src=$PWD,target=/src" \
       --workdir /src \
       rust:bookworm
   ```
1. In the container install dependencies with:
   ```shell
   # The parameter given is which additional target debian architecture to enable (amd64, arm64, etc.)
   # If your native platform is amd64, running with arm64 is enough to cover both archs.
   platform/debian/scripts/install_ci_build_dependencies.sh arm64
   ```
1. In the container launch the deb build:
   ```shell
   platform/debian/scripts/build_debs.sh aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
   # Again, multiple targets also work:
   platform/debian/scripts/build_debs.sh {aarch64,x86_64}-unknown-linux-gnu
   ```
1. You can now exit the container, the package paths displayed at the end under `target` will
   persist.

## Adding or amending a deb package
The rough overview of steps is:
1. Add cargo-deb specific metadata to the rust package and any static assets in the per package
   directory.
1. Add any necessary build changes to the `platform/debian/` directory.
1. Submit both changes as a PR and add the `PPA` tag or get a reviewer to add it for you. Without
   the tag a PR will not trigger the necessary CI runs.
1. Iterate on the PR until CI is happy.

### More details for package side steps
- Packages are primarily based on their package specific `Cargo.toml` definition read by `cargo-deb`. For
an example, see `unix_integration/resolver/Cargo.toml`
- A package specific `debian` folder is used for static assets. See: `unix_integration/resolver/debian` for an example.
- The debian folder may house needed `postinst`, `prerm` etc hook definitions.
They must include the `#DEBHELPER#` comment after any custom actions.
- The package debian folder is also used for any systemd unit files. The file naming pattern is very
specific, refer to `cargo-deb` documentation for details.
- As per Debian policy, binaries and shared libraries must be in separate deb packages. It's also easier to package them that way.

### More details for automation side steps
- Changes under `platform/debian/` are needed if a new binary and/or package is added, or if build time dependencies change.
- Amend `scripts/crossbuild.sh` build rules to include new binaries or shared libraries.
Search for the lines starting with `cross build`.
- Add any new build time system dependencies to `scripts/install_ci_build_dependencies.sh`, be aware
  of any difference in package names between Debian & Ubuntu.
- Add any new packages to `scripts/build_debs.sh`, search for the line starting with `for package in`.
