# Server Configuration

In this section we will configure your server and create its container instance.

## Configuring server.toml

There are two methods for configuration:

1. Providing a configuration file in the volume named `server.toml`. (Within the container it should
   be `/data/server.toml`)
2. Using environment variables to specify configuration options (uppercased, prefixed with
   `KANIDM_`).

You can use one or both methods, but environment variables take precedence over options specified in
files.The full options and explanations are in the
[kanidmd_core::config::ServerConfig](https://kanidm.github.io/kanidm/master/rustdoc/kanidmd_core/config/struct.ServerConfig.html)
docs page for your particular build.

The following is a commented example configuration.

```toml
{{#rustdoc_include ../../examples/server_container.toml}}
```

This example is located in
[examples/server_container.toml](https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm/blob/master/examples/server_container.toml).

### Check the configuration is valid

You should test your configuration is valid before you proceed. This defaults to using
`-c /data/server.toml`.

```bash
docker run --rm -i -t -v kanidmd:/data \
    kanidm/server:latest /sbin/kanidmd configtest
```

## Run the Server

Now we can run the server so that it can accept connections. The container defaults to using a
configuration file in `/data/server.toml`.

```bash
docker run -p 443:8443 -v kanidmd:/data kanidm/server:latest
```

### Using the NET\_BIND\_SERVICE capability

If you plan to run without using docker port mapping or some other reverse proxy, and your
`bindaddress` or `ldapbindaddress` port is less than `1024` you will need the `NET_BIND_SERVICE` in
docker to allow these port binds. You can add this with `--cap-add` in your docker run command.

```bash
docker run --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE \
  --network [host OR macvlan OR ipvlan] \
  -v kanidmd:/data \
  kanidm/server:latest
```

text=However you choose to run your server, you should document and keep note of the docker run / create command you chose to start the instance. This will be used in the upgrade procedure.
}}

### Default Admin Accounts

Now that the server is running, you can initialise the default admin accounts. There are two
parallel admin accounts that have seperate functions. `admin` which manages Kanidm's configuration,
and `idm_admin` which manages accounts and groups in Kanidm.

You should consider these as "break-glass" accounts. They exist to allow the server to be
bootstrapped and accessed in emergencies. They are not intended for day-to-day use.

These commands will generate a new random password for the admin accounts. You must run the commands
as the same user as the kanidmd process or as root. This defaults to using `-c /data/server.toml`.

```bash
docker exec -i -t <container name> \
  kanidmd recover-account admin
#  new_password: "xjgG4..."
```

```bash
docker exec -i -t <container name> \
  kanidmd recover-account idm_admin
#  new_password: "9Eux1..."
```
