# Troubleshooting

Some things to try.

## Is the server started?

If you don't see "ready to rock! ðŸª¨" in your logs, it's not started. Scroll back and look for
errors!dd

## Can you connect?

If the server's running on `idm.example.com:8443` then a simple connectivity test is done using
[curl](https://curl.se).

Run the following command:

```shell
curl -k https://idm.example.com:8443/status
```

This is similar to what you _should_ see:

```shell
{{#rustdoc_include troubleshooting/curl_connection_test.txt}}
```

This means:

1. you've successfully connected to a host (10.0.0.14),
2. TLS worked
3. Received the status response "true"

If you see something like this:

```
âžœ curl -v https://idm.example.com:8443
*   Trying 10.0.0.1:8443...
* connect to 10.0.0.1 port 8443 failed: Connection refused
* Failed to connect to idm.example.com port 8443 after 5 ms: Connection refused
* Closing connection 0
curl: (7) Failed to connect to idm.example.com port 8443 after 5 ms: Connection refused
```

Then either your DNS is wrong (it's pointing at 10.0.0.1) or you can't connect to the server for
some reason.

If you get errors about certificates, try adding `-k` to skip certificate verification checking and
just test connectivity:

```
curl -vk https://idm.example.com:8443
```

## Server things to check

- Has the config file got `bindaddress = "127.0.0.1:8443"` ? Change it to
  `bindaddress = "[::]:8443"`, so it listens on all interfaces.
- Is there a firewall on the server?
- If you're running in docker, did you expose the port? (`-p 8443:8443`)

## Client things to check

Try running commands with `RUST_LOG=debug` to get more information:

```
RUST_LOG=debug kanidm login --name anonymous
```
