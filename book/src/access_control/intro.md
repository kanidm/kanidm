# Access Control

While Kanidm exists to make authorisation decisions on behalf of other services, internally it must
make decisions about writes operations to the entries within its database. To make these choices,
Kanidm has an internal set of access controls which are the rules describing who may perform what
actions.

## Default Permissions

The project ships default access controls which are designed to limit and isolate the privileges of
accounts whenever possible.

This separation is the reason why `admins` and `idm_admins` exist as separate groups. There are two
distinct access silos within Kanidm. Access to manage Kanidm as a service (such as application
integrations and domain naming) and access to manage people and groups. This is to limit the
possible harm that an attacker may make if they gain access to these roles.

## Assigning Permissions to Persons

Kanidm supports [privilege access mode](../accounts/authentication_and_credentials.md) so that
high-level permissions can be assigned to users who must reauthenticate before using those
privileges. The privileges then are only accessible for a short period of time. This can allow you
to assign high level permissions to regular persions accounts rather than requiring separete
privilege access accounts (PAA) or privileged access workstations (PAW).

## Assigning Permissions to Service Accounts

Service account tokens can be issued with read-only or read-write flags, where read-only tokens are
unable to modify content of Kanidm. This can allow the service account to have higher level
permissions assigned but only usable with a short lived or isolated read-write token.

## Permission Delegation

A number of types in Kanidm allow permission delegation such as groups and service accounts. This
allows entries to be assigned an entry manager who has write access to that entity but not all
entities of the same class.

## High Privilege Groups

Kanidm has a special group called `idm_high_privilege`. This acts as a "taint" on its members to
indicate that they have an elevated level of access within Kanidm or other systems.

This taint flag exists to prevent lateral movement from other roles that have higher levels of
privilege.

An example is `idm_service_desk` which has the ability to trigger credential resets for users. This
is an important aspect of the service desk role. However, a member of the service desk should not be
able to modify the credentials of their peers, nor should they be able to escalate by accessing the
credentials of users in a role such as `idm_admins`. Since `idm_service_desk` and `idm_admins` are
both tainted with `idm_high_privilege` then this lateral movement is not possible. Only high
privileged roles are able to then reset the accounts of high privilege users.

You may add other groups to `idm_high_privilege` to achieve the same taint effect for other
services.

## Default Permission Groups

Kanidm ships with default permission groups. You can use these to enable accounts to perform certain
tasks within Kanidm as required.

| group name                   | description                                                             |

| `idm_people_on_boarding`     | create (but not modify) persons. Intended for use with service accounts |
| `idm_people_pii_read`        | allow read to personally identifying information                        |
| `idm_people_self_write_mail` | allow self-modification of the mail attribute                           |
| `idm_radius_servers`         | read user radius secrets. Intended for use with service accounts        |
| `idm_radius_service_admins`  | create and reset user radius secrets, and allow users to access radius  |
| `idm_recycle_bin_admins`     | modify and restore entries from the recycle bin                         |
| `idm_schema_admins`          | add and modify elements of schema                                       |

## Default Roles

Kanidm ships with 3 high level permission groups. These roles have no inherent permissions, they are
created by being members of the default permission groups.

| group name         | description                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `idm_admins`       | manage persons and their groups                          |
| `idm_service_desk` | assist persons with credential resets or other queries   |
| `system_admins`    | manage the operation of Kanidm as a database and service |
