# Accounts and groups

Accounts and Groups are the primary reasons for Kanidm to exist. Kanidm is optimised as a repository
for these data. As a result, there are many concepts and important details to understand.

## Service Accounts vs Person Accounts

Kanidm separates accounts into two types. Person accounts (or persons) are intended for use by
humans that will access the system in an interactive way. Service accounts are intended for use by
computers or services that need to identify themself to Kanidm. Generally a person or group of
persons will be responsible for and will manage service accounts. Because of this distinction these
classes of accounts have different properties and methods of authentication and management.

## Groups

Groups represent a collection of entities. This generally is a collection of persons or service
accounts. Groups are commonly used to assign privileges to the accounts that are members of a group.
This allows easier administration over larger systems where privileges can be assigned to groups in
a logical manner, and then only membership of the groups need administration, rather than needing to
assign privileges to each entity directly and uniquely.

Groups may also be nested, where a group can contain another group as a member. This allows
hierarchies to be created again for easier administration.

## Default Accounts and Groups

Kanidm ships with a number of default service accounts and groups. This is to give you the best
out-of-box experience possible, as well as supplying best practice examples related to modern
Identity Management (IDM) systems.

There are two "break-glass" system administration accounts.

`admin` is the default service account which has privileges to configure and administer Kanidm as a
whole. This account can manage access controls, schema, integrations and more. However the `admin`
can not manage persons by default.

`idm_admin` is the default service account which has privileges to create persons and to manage
these accounts and groups. They can perform credential resets and more.

Both the `admin` and the `idm_admin` user should _NOT_ be used for daily activities - they exist for
initial system configuration, and for disaster recovery scenarios. You should delegate permissions
as required to named user accounts instead.

The majority of the builtin groups are privilege groups that provide rights over Kanidm
administrative actions. These include groups for account management, person management (personal and
sensitive data), group management, and more.

`admin` and `idm_admin` both inherit their privileges from these default groups. This allows you to
assign persons to these roles instead.

## Reauthentication and Session Privilege

Kanidm sessions have a concept of session privilege. Conceptually you can consider this like `sudo`
on unix systems or `uac` on windows. This allows a session to briefly access its write permissions
by reauthentication with the identical credential they logged in with.

This allows safe assignment of high privilege roles to persons since their sessions do not have
access to their write privileges by default. They must reauthenticate and use their privileges
within a short time window.

However, these sessions always retain their _read_ privileges - meaning that they can still access
and view high levels of data at any time without reauthentication.

In high risk environments you should still consider assigning seperate administration accounts to
users if this is considered a risk.

## Recovering the Initial Admin Accounts

By default the `admin` and `idm_admin` accounts have no password, and can not be accessed. They need
to be "recovered" from the server that is running the kanidmd server.

You should have already recovered the admin account during your setup process. If not, refer to the
[server configuration chapter](server_configuration.md#default-admin-account) on how to recover
these accounts.

These accounts will be used through the remainder of this document for managing the server.

## Viewing Default Groups

You should take some time to inspect the default groups which are related to default roles and
permissions. Each group has a description to explain its purpose. These can be viewed with:

```bash
kanidm group list --name idm_admin
kanidm group get <name>
```

## Why Can't I Change admin With idm\_admin?

As a security mechanism there is a distinction between "accounts" and "high permission accounts".
This is to help prevent elevation attacks, where a member of a service desk could attempt to reset
the password of idm\_admin or admin, or even a member of HR or System Admin teams to move laterally.

Generally, membership of a "privilege" group that ships with Kanidm, such as:

- idm\_account\_manage\_priv
- idm\_people\_read\_priv
- idm\_schema\_manage\_priv
- many more ...

...indirectly grants you membership to "idm\_high\_privilege". If you are a member of this group,
the standard "account" and "people" rights groups are NOT able to alter, read or manage these
accounts. To manage these accounts higher rights are required, such as those held by the admin
account.

Further, groups that are considered "idm\_high\_privilege" can NOT be managed by the standard
"idm\_group\_manage\_priv" group.

Management of high privilege accounts and groups is granted through the the "hp" variants of all
privileges. A non-conclusive list:

- idm\_hp\_account\_read\_priv
- idm\_hp\_account\_manage\_priv
- idm\_hp\_account\_write\_priv
- idm\_hp\_group\_manage\_priv
- idm\_hp\_group\_write\_priv

Membership of any of these groups should be considered to be equivalent to system administration
rights in the directory, and by extension, over all network resources that trust Kanidm.

All groups that are flagged as "idm\_high\_privilege" should be audited and monitored to ensure that
they are not altered.
