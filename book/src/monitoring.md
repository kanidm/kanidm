[take part in the discussion at github.com/kanidm/kanidm/issues/216](https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm/issues/216).

## kanidmd

kanidmd currently responds to HTTP GET requests at the `/status` endpoint with a JSON object of
either "true" or "false". `true` indicates that the platform is responding to requests.
