		#  response to be checked against plain-text,
		#  or crypt'd passwords.
		#

	#  a trusted CA you may use the 'snakeoil' certificates.
	#  Included with the server in raddb/certs.
	#
	#  If these certificates have not been auto-generated:
	#    cd raddb/certs

	#
	#  These test certificates SHOULD NOT be used in a normal
	#  deployment.  They are created only to make it easier
	#  to install the server, and to perform some simple
	#  tests with EAP-TLS, TTLS, or PEAP.

	#
	#  Note that you should NOT use a globally known CA here!
	#  e.g. using a Verisign cert as a "known CA" means that
	#  ANYONE who has a certificate signed by them can
	#  authenticate via EAP-TLS!  This is likely not what you want.
