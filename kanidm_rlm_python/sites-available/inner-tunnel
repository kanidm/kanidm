#  If it works, you have configured the inner tunnel correctly.  To check
#  if PEAP will work, use:
#
#	$ radtest -t mschap USER PASSWORD 127.0.0.1:18120 0 testing123
#
#  If that works, PEAP should work.  If that command doesn't work, then
#
#	FIX THE INNER TUNNEL CONFIGURATION SO THAT IT WORKS.
#
#  Do NOT do any PEAP tests.  It won't help.  Instead, concentrate
#  on fixing the inner tunnel configuration.  DO NOTHING ELSE.

	#  Note that proxying the inner tunnel authentication means

	#  (e.g. "user@example.com").  The inner session will then be
	#  proxied elsewhere for authentication.  If you are not
	#  careful, this means that the user can cause you to forward
	#  the authentication to another RADIUS server, and have the
	#  accounting logs *not* sent to the other server.  This makes

#  Authentication.
#
#
#  This section lists which modules are available for authentication.
#  Note that it does NOT mean 'try each module in order'.  It means
#  that a module from the 'authorize' section adds a configuration
#  attribute 'Auth-Type := FOO'.  That authentication type is then
#  used to pick the appropriate module from the list below.
#

#  In general, you SHOULD NOT set the Auth-Type attribute.  The server
#  will figure it out on its own, and will do the right thing.  The
#  most common side effect of erroneously setting the Auth-Type
#  attribute is that one authentication method will work, but the
#  others will not.
#
#  The common reasons to set the Auth-Type attribute by hand
#  is to either forcibly reject the user, or forcibly accept him.

	#
