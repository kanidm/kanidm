		#  authentication.  This allows the EAP-GTC
		#  response to be checked against plain-text,
		#  or crypt'd passwords.
		#

	#  If OpenSSL was not found at the time the server was
	#  built, the "tls", "ttls", and "peap" sections will
	#  be ignored.

	#  If you do not currently have certificates signed by
	#  a trusted CA you may use the 'snakeoil' certificates.
	#  Included with the server in raddb/certs.
	#
	#  If these certificates have not been auto-generated:
	#    cd raddb/certs
	#    make
	#
	#  These test certificates SHOULD NOT be used in a normal
	#  deployment.  They are created only to make it easier
	#  to install the server, and to perform some simple
	#  tests with EAP-TLS, TTLS, or PEAP.
	#
	#  See also:

	#  http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,9286052~mode=flat
	#
	#  Note that you should NOT use a globally known CA here!
	#  e.g. using a Verisign cert as a "known CA" means that
	#  ANYONE who has a certificate signed by them can
	#  authenticate via EAP-TLS!  This is likely not what you want.
