DO NOT ADD MORE TESTS TO THIS DIRECTORY

Add them to the `testkit` directory.

Each new test in this folder is a separate binary, that must be complied linked and executed. This
takes HUGES AMOUNTS OF TIME. It makes tests unbelievably slow.

If you want to add an integration test, put it into the testkit dir so it becomes part of the
single larger integration test runner.
