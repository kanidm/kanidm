/*
 * domain functional levels
 *
 * The idea here is to allow topology wide upgrades to be performed. We have to
 * assume that across multiple kanidm instances there may be cases where we have version
 * N and version N minus 1 as upgrades are rolled out.
 *
 * Imagine we set up a new cluster. Machine A and B both have level 1 support.
 * We upgrade machine A. It has support up to level 2, but machine B does not.
 * So the overall functional level is level 1. Then we upgrade B, which supports
 * up to level 2. We still don't do the upgrade! The topology is still level 1
 * unless an admin at this point *intervenes* and forces the update. OR what
 * happens we we update machine A again and it now supports up to level 3, with
 * a target level of 2. So we update machine A now to level 2, and that can
 * still replicate to machine B since it also supports level 2.
 *
 * effectively it means that "some features" may be a "release behind" for users
 * who don't muck with the levels, but it means that we can do mixed version
 * upgrades.
