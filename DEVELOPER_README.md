## Getting Started (for Developers)

### Designs

See the [designs] folder, and compile the private documentation locally:

```
cargo doc --document-private-items --open --no-deps
```

[designs]: https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm/tree/master/designs

### Minimum Supported Rust Version

The project is expected to work on MSRV of 1.47.0.

### Dependencies

#### MacOS

You will need [rustup] to install a rust toolchain.

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/

If you plan to work on the web-ui, you may also need npm for setting up some parts.

    brew install npm

#### SUSE

You will need [rustup] to install a rust toolchain.

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/

You will also need some system libraries to build this:

    libudev-devel sqlite3-devel libopenssl-devel npm-default


### Get involved

To get started, you'll need to fork or branch, and we'll merge based on PR's.

If you are a contributor to the project, simply clone:

```
git clone git@github.com:kanidm/kanidm.git
```

If you are forking, then Fork in github and clone with:

```
git clone https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm.git
cd kanidm
git remote add myfork git@github.com:<YOUR USERNAME>/kanidm.git
```

Select and issue (and always feel free to reach out to us for advice!), and create a branch to
start working:

```
git branch <feature-branch-name>
git checkout <feature-branche-name>
cargo test
```

When you are ready for review (even if the feature isn't complete and you just want some advice)

```
cargo test
git commit -m 'Commit message' change_file.rs ...
git push <myfork/origin> <feature-branch-name>
```

If you get advice or make changes, just keep commiting to the branch, and pushing to your branch.
When we are happy with the code, we'll merge in github, meaning you can now cleanup your branch.

```
git checkout master
git pull
git branch -D <feature-branch-name>
```

Rebasing:

If you are asked to rebase your change, follow these steps:

```
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout <feature-branche-name>
git rebase master
```

Then be sure to fix any merge issues or other comments as they arise. If you have issues, you can
always stop and reset with:

```
git rebase --abort
```

### Development Server Quickstart for Interactive Testing

After getting the code, you will need a rust environment. Please investigate rustup for your platform
to establish this.

Once you have the source code, you need certificates to use with the server. I recommend using
let's encrypt, but if this is not possible, please use our insecure cert tool. Without certificates
authentication will fail.

    mkdir insecure
    cd insecure
    ../insecure_generate_tls.sh

You can now build and run the server with the commands below. It will use a database in /tmp/kanidm.db

    cd kanidmd
    cargo run -- recover_account -c ./server.toml -n admin
    cargo run -- server -c ./server.toml

In a new terminal, you can now build and run the client tools with:

    cd kanidm_tools
    cargo run -- --help
    cargo run -- login -H https://localhost:8443 -D anonymous -C ../insecure/ca.pem
    cargo run -- self whoami -H https://localhost:8443 -D anonymous -C ../insecure/ca.pem
    cargo run -- login -H https://localhost:8443 -D admin -C ../insecure/ca.pem
    cargo run -- self whoami -H https://localhost:8443 -D admin -C ../insecure/ca.pem

### Building the Web UI

The web ui uses rust wasm rather than javascript. To build this you need to setup the environment.

    cargo install wasm-pack
    npm install --global rollup

Then you are able to build the ui.

    cd kanidmd_web_ui/
    ./build_wasm.sh

The "developer" profile for kanidmd will automatically use the pkg output in this folder.
